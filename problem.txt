Build a mini “Procure-to-Pay” system (inspired by Payhawk: https://payhawk.com/en-eu/lp-procure-to-pay-software) with REST APIs using Django + Django REST Framework, containerized with Docker, and deployed publicly (AWS EC2, Render, Fly.io, or any VPS). This assessment evaluates your ability to write efficient, maintainable code handling complex business logic, multi-level workflows, and integration with external services.
Note: Use AI tools to meet the deadline (Cursor, Windsurf, etc).
Deliverables
A GitHub repository containing:
Django project & app source code
Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
API documentation (Swagger, Postman, or Markdown)
Short README: setup & run instructions, public IP/URL
Live instance accessible via public IP or domain
Problem Statement
Create a simplified Purchase Request & Approval System:
Staff submit purchase requests → multi-level managers approve/reject → finance can view approved requests.
Business Requirements
Staff can: create requests, view/update pending requests, submit receipts.
Approvers can: view pending requests, approve/reject, see reviewed requests.
Finance team: access and interact with requests via web UI, upload files.
Approval Workflow
Requests start as PENDING.
Requires approval from multiple levels.
Any rejection → request becomes REJECTED.
All required approvals → request becomes APPROVED.
Approved/rejected status cannot change.
Last approver generates a Purchase Order automatically.
System must handle concurrent interactions safely.
Document Processing (AI-Based)
Proforma upload → store file & extract key data
Automatic PO generation → extract vendor, items, prices, terms, store PO
Receipt validation → compare items/prices/seller to PO, flag discrepancies
Recommended libraries: pytesseract, pdfplumber, PyPDF2, OpenAI API
Technical Requirements
Data Models
User/Auth: Django User or custom; roles: staff, approver-level-1/2, finance; role-based access control
PurchaseRequest: title, description, amount, status (pending/approved/rejected), created_by, approved_by, timestamps, proforma, purchase_order, receipt
Optional: Approval model, RequestItem model
API Endpoints (Django REST Framework)
POST /api/requests/ → create request (Staff)
GET /api/requests/ → list requests (filtered by creator if staff)
GET /api/requests/{id}/ → view details
PATCH /api/requests/{id}/approve/ → approve (Approver)
PATCH /api/requests/{id}/reject/ → reject (Approver)
PUT /api/requests/{id}/ → update request (Staff, if pending)
POST /api/requests/{id}/submit-receipt/ → submit receipt (Staff)
Requirements: authentication (Token/JWT/Session), role-based access control, validation, proper HTTP codes, file uploads, data consistency, performance optimization.
Document Processing Implementation
Proforma: accept uploads, store, extract metadata
Automatic PO: triggered on final approval, extract details, generate PO document
Receipt validation: accept upload, extract data, compare with PO, return validation results
Approach can use text extraction, OCR, AI/LLM, or combination
Dockerization
Provide Dockerfile, optional docker-compose.yml
Include required services (PostgreSQL, Redis if needed)
Running:
git clone <repo>
cd project
docker-compose up --build
Frontend Implementation
Framework: React (hooks) or Vanilla JS (ES6+)
Features: login, dashboard by role, request form with file upload, list view with filtering/status, detail view with approval history, approve/reject UI, receipt upload, role-based UI
Responsive, clean interface, proper feedback & error handling
Consume REST API, handle auth tokens/sessions, proper error handling
Optional: serve separate or integrated with Django, CORS, UI libraries
AI Feature
Request submission → quotation/proforma → automatic PO generation
Post-purchase receipt → compare item/price/seller to PO → trigger error if mismatch
Deployment
Public environment: AWS EC2, Render, Fly.io, Railway, DigitalOcean, or VPS
Accessible via public URL, both backend & frontend functional
Include deployment URL & documentation
Optional Features
Swagger UI / Postman collection
Email notifications on approval/rejection
Pagination/filtering
GitHub Actions for Docker build & deploy
